		story: 'Mostly everyone from Asia have their own way of doing egg fried rice. It’s such a common dish that as long as you don’t hate rice or egg you would love it. My mom taught me how to do egg fried rice since like the fourth grade of my primary school. It is fast, yummy yet different from all the other egg fried rice that I have tasted from others, including my grandmother’s. I would be able to eat a big bowl of it even if I’m not hungry. I’m missing it at this moment.',
		ingredients: ['Overnight Rice', 'Egg', 'Soy sauce'],
		steps: [
			'Heat the pan then add oil',
			'Fry the egg and break it into small fragments before it is fully cooked',
			'Add rice and press with spatula to stop rice from sticking to each other',
			'Repeat to fry and press until dry enough and nothing is sticking to other',
			'Add soy sauce and fry until well mixed'
